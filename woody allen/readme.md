## Using data to map Woody Allen's Career ##

If you watched "A rainy day in New York" on Netflix recently and was as charmed as I was, you'll like this project!  

While data analysis is used extensively to do more "serious" stuff (LIKE world domination ðŸ¤¯),
it can also be a great tool to explore the lives, history and biography of people around us and tell their stories.

Read ahead to learn more about how I use data here to map Woody's illustrious (and controversial ðŸ˜ˆ) career!

# Dataset #

I used tables that I extracted from Wikipedia for this project:
* [Woody Allen: Filmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen_filmography)
* [List of Awards and Nominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Woody_Allen)

Go check out my dashboard and see if you can find out which tables I used to make them.

# Tools #
 This is the first very short exploratory project that I did using SQL. Tools that I used:
 
 * MYSQL: open source SQL based database.
 * Tableau Public : open source visualization software.
